	<h3>NYC</h3>
	
	<p>1. Upstate: One of the best seafood places in town, and not even expensive. Amazing oyster selection. Pro tips: 5-7 every day is oyster happy hour; a selection of 6 amazing oysters (not your average Blue Points) and a craft beer for $12. No reservations and wait can be an hour during peak times, so best to come when relaxed, such as on a weekend, and grab a drink nearby if there's a wait (good specialty beer bar nearby: Prolteriat)</p>

	<p>2. Maialino: They considered charging me rent at this restaurant, kinda live here. It's a classy but not uptight Italian spot with a lot of NYC character, and sometimes fun people watching. The food is just fun and everything is extremely well done, pastas tend to be amazing but really everything is. Their tasting menu is the way to go if you have time. Also, one of the best wine lists in NYC (try a Gattinara if you like big reds, it's like a Barolo without the branding).</p>

	<p>3. Sushi Tsushima: take someone you love and go experience the Omakase. I just had it yesterday for the second time. No frills, no gold and macho NYC sushi vibe - real Japan. Extraordinary fish, %80 of it from Japan. Go.</p>
